# Problem 1

``` r
library(readxl)
setwd("C:/Users/13038/Downloads/p8105_hw2_as6183_data")
Trash_Wheel = read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx")
Trash_Wheel = Trash_Wheel[na.omit(Trash_Wheel$Dumpster),]
Trash_Wheel$`Sports Balls`=round(Trash_Wheel$`Sports Balls`)
Trash_Wheel$`Sports Balls`=as.integer(Trash_Wheel$`Sports Balls`)
Precip_2017 = read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",skip=1,sheet=6)
Precip_2018 = read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",skip=1,sheet=5)
Precip_2017 = Precip_2017[-13,]
Precip_2018 = Precip_2018[-13,]
Precip_2017$Year = rep(2017,12)
Precip_2018$Year = rep(2018,12)
Precip_Combined = rbind(Precip_2017,Precip_2018)
Precip_Combined$Month = as.character(Precip_Combined$Month)
Precip_Combined$Month = rep(month.name,2)
library(dplyr)
colnames(Trash_Wheel)[13] = "Sports_Balls" 
```

For the Mr. Trash Wheel Data set there were 344 observations and 17
variables. For the combined precipitation data set there were 24
observations and 3 variables. Some key variables in the Mr. Trash Wheel
data set are the Dumpster number, Month, Year, and Weight of trash
collected in tons. For the available observations, the total
precipitation for 2018 was 32.93 inches and the median number of sport
balls in 2017 was 8.

# Problem 2

``` r
setwd("C:/Users/13038/Downloads/p8105_hw2_as6183_data")
Subway_Data= read.csv("NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv")
Subway_Data = select(Subway_Data,c(seq(2,18),20,23))
Subway_Data$Entry = recode(Subway_Data$Entry,YES = T, NO = F)
```

This data set is data on Subway Stations and includes information such
as station’s name, station’s line, station’s latitude, station’s
longitude, routes that the station serves, entrance type of the station,
whether the station’s entry is allowed or not (T/F), whether there is
vending in the station or not(YES/NO), and whether the station is ADA
compliant or not (T/F). Some data cleaning steps that I have taken so
far are removing any uneccesary columns that I won’t need in my analysis
as well as recoding the entry variable from being a YES/NO variable to
being a True or False variable. There are 1868 rows and 19 columns in
the data frame as of now. The data is not completely tidy yet as there
are still many duplicate rows that contain the same information in the
data set.

There are 684 distinct stations in this dataset. There are also 179 ADA
compliant stations in the dataset. The proportion of stations that allow
entry even though they do not have vending is 0.0657895.

``` r
library(tidyr)
distinct_data = distinct(Subway_Data)
Subway_Data = Subway_Data%>%
  mutate_if(is.integer,as.character)
Subway_Data = pivot_longer(Subway_Data,Route1:Route11,names_to="Route Name",values_to="Route Number")
head(Subway_Data[,c("Line","Station.Name","Route Name","Route Number")])
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 4
    ##   Line     Station.Name `Route Name` `Route Number`
    ##   <chr>    <chr>        <chr>        <chr>         
    ## 1 4 Avenue 25th St      Route1       "R"           
    ## 2 4 Avenue 25th St      Route2       ""            
    ## 3 4 Avenue 25th St      Route3       ""            
    ## 4 4 Avenue 25th St      Route4       ""            
    ## 5 4 Avenue 25th St      Route5       ""            
    ## 6 4 Avenue 25th St      Route6       ""

From the head of the Subway Data data frame above, it can now be seen
that route name and route number are distinct variables.

Of the stations that serve the A train, 34 are ADA compliant.

# Problem 3

``` r
setwd("C:/Users/13038/Downloads/p8105_hw2_as6183_data")
pols = read.csv("pols-month.csv")
unemployment = read.csv("unemployment.csv")
snp = read.csv("snp.csv")
pols = separate(pols,col="mon",into=c("year","month","day"),sep="-")
pols$year = as.integer(pols$year)
pols$day = as.integer(pols$day)
pols$month[seq(1,816)] = rep(month.name,68)
pols$month[seq(817,822)] = month.name[seq(1,6)]
pols$president = ifelse(pols$prez_dem==1,"dem","gop")
pols = select(pols,-c("prez_dem","prez_gop","day"))
snp = separate(snp,col="date",into=c("month","day","year"),sep="/")
snp$year = as.integer(snp$year)
snp$day = as.integer(snp$day)
snp$month[seq(1,7)] = month.name[seq(7,1,-1)]
snp$month[seq(8,787)] = rep(month.name[seq(12,1,-1)],65)
snp = select(snp,c("year","month",-"day","close"))
colnames(unemployment)[seq(2,13)] = month.name
unemployment$Year = factor(unemployment$Year)
unemployment<- gather(unemployment,month,Unemployment_Rate, January:December, factor_key=TRUE)
colnames(unemployment)[1] = "year"
combined_1 = merge(pols,snp,by=c("year","month"))
combined_final = merge(combined_1,unemployment,by=c("year","month"))
```

For the original data sets, the “pols-month” data set contained 822
observations and 9 variables that gave information on the number of
national politicians who are democratic or republican at any time. The
“snp” data set contained 787 observations of 2 variables that gave
information about the Standard and Poor’s stock market index which is
generally used as a measure of the stock market as a whole. The
“unemployment” data set contained 68 observations of 13 variables
which gave information about the unemployment rate for certain time
periods which are in months and years. The resulting data set after
combining all three of these data sets contains 786 rows and 11 columns.
This combined data set also contains information from a range of 65
years. Some key variables are year, month, Unemployment\_Rate,
president, and close which gives information on the year, month, rate of
unemployment, whether the president is democratic or republican, and the
closing value of the S\&P index at that particular month and year
respectively.
